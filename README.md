# Mboacare: Create a platform to link-up medical facilities globally:

This repository is dedicated to tracking the progress of our project for the contribution phase. We will be using it to report on our project and keep a record of our work.

## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
"In the global world of healthcare, the ability to  connect medical facilities and provide accessible healthcare services remains a persistent challenge which cause mortality in the society. Patients often face challenges in locating hospital with medical facilities to treat a particular disease/illness, while hospitals struggle to refer patients to appropriate specialized centers. As a result, there is a significant need for a  platform that bridges the gap in healthcare connectivity.


## 💡 Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
The "Mboacare" project seeks to address these challenges by providing an app where hospitals can register their facilities, enabling seamless patient referrals and empowering patients to easily locate and access the healthcare services they require. Its primary goal is to improve healthcare connectivity.
 This project aims to revolutionize healthcare connectivity, making it more accessible and reducing mortality rate.

  ## Build an APK🚀
-  Enter cd [project]
- Run: flutter build apk --split-per-abi
(The flutter build command defaults to --release.)
This command results in three APK files:

- [project]/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-armeabi-v7a-release.apk
- [project]/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk
- [project]/build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-x86_64-release.apk
  
Removing the `--split-per-abi` flag results in a fat APK that contains your code compiled for all the target ABIs. Such APKs are larger in size than their split counterparts, causing the user to download native binaries that are not applicable to their device’s architecture.

## Install APK on Android Device
Load one of the `.apk` files listed above. Which file to load depends on what kind of processor is running on your device.
